# CCXT Go
Transpiled [CCXT exchange library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) from their original JavaScript source to Go (Golang).

## Features
- support 100+ cryptocurrency exchanges with a unified API
- fully implemented public and private APIs for fetching market data, trading, arbitrage, etc..


### Requirements
```
Go >= 1.13
```

### Installation
```
go get github.com/loganetherton/ccxt-go
```
Take a look into [ccxt_test.go](pkg/ccxt/ccxt_test.go) for an example how to get started.


## Alpha Release
Itâ€™s all still very alpha, so no guarantees of any kind.
Especially some rarely used helper functions are not implemented yet and
just panic with a todo message. If you need these exchanges you will
need to implement those.
